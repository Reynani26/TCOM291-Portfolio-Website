											<h1>About me</h1>
										</header>
										<p><strong>
											Hi there! My name is Reynan Ordonez, and I am currently a second year
											Computer Systems Technology Student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I have a strong
											interest in computer hardware, and have built many computers for myself and friends.
											Something that I found out through the Computer Systems Technology Program is that I have
											a strong skill in working with data, specifically database management, and I hope to work
											in a field that deals with working with data. I also have an interest in the creation of websites. The process of building a website
                                            is very interesting and fun, and definitely has peaked my interest.

                                        </strong></p>
                                        <p style="padding-top: 100px"><strong>P.S. I also really like pandas!</strong></p>

														<h3>Mock Project Card Game</h3>

                                                        Mock Project for Saskatchewan Polytechnic that involved creating
                                                        two card games (21 and Memory) using JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap. Application was
                                                        made with classmates for a project.

                                                                made the first half the project very difficult. The biggest takeaway I took from the project
                                                                was that communication as a team is very important to ensure that everyone was on the same page.
                                                                Fortunately, we were able to pull it off and make a functioning application.

                                                                I definitely made mistakes during the process, but my communication with the team has improved.
                                                                Working with clients that expect a fully functioning application does put a lot of pressure, but
                                                                the biggest thing I tried to focus on was just enjoying the developing process. It was definitely cool
                                                                to see a working application that I contributed to, that is going to be used in real time.
